Branch with Stack in it. That is the Stack Layout + The Stack's Code Behind.
Expected to later be merged with main, together with a flex layout, absolute layout and possibly a grid layout(?).

Changelog:
02:24 - 05/24 2024
Overwrote old useless files with the new files from main and added the Stack Layout and Code Behind. Code Behind has nothing interesting except a function used in testing.

The page is simply called "Stack". 

Example: await Navigation.PushAsync(**Stack()**);
